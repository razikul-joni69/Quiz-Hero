                    what is the difference between map filter foreach and find?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    In JavaScript, map(), filter(), forEach() and find() are all
                    array methods that allow you to iterate over an array and
                    perform some operation on each element. The main difference
                    between these methods is what they return.
                    <li>
                        map() returns a new array with the transformed elements.
                        It does not change the original array.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        filter() returns a new array with all elements that pass
                        the test implemented by the provided function.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        forEach() does not return anything. It just executes a
                        provided function once for each array element.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        find() returns the value of the first element in an
                        array that satisfies a provided testing function.
                    </li>

                    what is the difference between localstorage sessionstorage
                    and cookies?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    In web development, localStorage, sessionStorage, and
                    cookies are all ways to store data on the client-side. The
                    main differences between them are:

                    <li>
                        Local storage is useful for storing data that the user
                        will need to access later, such as offline data.The
                        stored data is not deleted when the browser is
                        closed.This is especially useful for storing data that
                        you want to persist even if the user closes the browser,
                        such as preferences or settings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Session storage is a great way to improve the
                        performance of your web applications.The data is stored
                        only for the session and will be deleted when the
                        browser is closed.Session storage is useful for storing
                        data that is sensitive, such as login credentials.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cookies are a good choice for storing data that should
                        not be persisted for a long time, such as session
                        IDs.The data can be set to expire at a certain
                        time.Cookies are often used to store data that is not
                        sensitive, such as user preferences

                <h1 class="text-3xl">what is event loop how it works?</h1>
                <p>
                    JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which
                    is responsible for executing the code, collecting and
                    processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. In
                    JavaScript, the event loop is a mechanism that allows
                    asynchronous code to run in a single-threaded environment.
                    The event loop continuously checks if there are any tasks in
                    the task queue. If there are any tasks, it will push them
                    onto the call stack for execution. Once the call stack is
                    empty, the event loop will check the task queue again for
                    new tasks. The event loop is responsible for executing code
                    in a non-blocking way. This means that while one piece of
                    code is executing, other code can still be executed at the
                    same time. This is what allows JavaScript to handle multiple
                    requests at once without blocking.

                    This quizTimer function checking how many time consuming to
